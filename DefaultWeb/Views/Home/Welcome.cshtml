        <h5 class="text-left"><em>Default Web Site.net Core is not...well, exactly &quot;Default&quot; in nature, as one may infer from first impressions.</em></h5>

        <p class="text-center mx-auto">
            I never imagined myself as a "Blogger" type and &quot;on-line&quot; self-promotion was never necessary
            or desired. I don't really do "Social Media", besides developing their integrations; and I didn't feel like joining a CodeProject
            like site, or some vanilla blog to "publish" my activities.

        <p class="text-center mt-0">It just didn&#39;t seem right<strong><em> and It didn't feel right...</em></strong></p>

            <strong><em><span style="font-size:1.5rem;font-style:italic">So what do I do?!?! </span></em></strong>

        <p class="text-left">
            I create my own multi-service Cloud and a personal Default Web Site.net Core!!! What else??? See &quot;About&quot; for some of the specs.

        <p class="text-left">
            There is a lot going on here. A couple things to look for...

        <p class="text-left">
            <em><strong>Rundowns and GitHub Repositories</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            Rundowns are my unathoritive casual white-papers. Covering whatever topics I may be facing. 
            Usually dealing with the function and design of the site itself, or the Scalable Document Archive Server. 
            Some rundowns may reference a cooresponding GitHub respositry, indicated by the GitHub kitty-cat. 
            The entire code base of DefaultWebsite.net Core is statically mirrored at GitHub from Visual Studio Team Foundatoin Services.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            The "Rundowns", pertinent GitHub repositories and the site functionality itself are the primary focus.
            But there are a few other things to look for.

            The Sandbox is where the Live-Action happens!&nbsp; Sandbox Toys usually stem from something topical I am working on.
