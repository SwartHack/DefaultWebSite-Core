        Although the outward appearance does not reflect a "Default" nature, <span id="title">Default Web Site</span><span id="net">.net </span><span id="core">Core</span> implements many standard patterns and practices.
        The idea is to have a little fun and not be so boooorrrring  <img src="https://html5-editor.net/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-cool.gif" alt="cool" />

        was born from necessity. Its primary goal is to utilize and demonstrate the "Latest &amp; Greatest" Microsoft SqlServer 2017&trade; and ASP.Net Core&trade; 2.0 family of technologies.
        Also included in this primary purpose is the exploration into the many varieties and combinations of "Client-Side" technologies and "Frameworks".

        I never imagined myself as a "Blogger" type. I don't really do "Social Media", besides developing their integrations; and I didn't feel
        like joining one of hundreds of sites, or some vanilla blog to "publish" my activities.

        <h3>So what do I do?!?!</h3>
        <h4>I create my own multi-service Cloud and a personal Default Web Site.net Core!!!</h4>
        <h3>What Else?!?!</h3>
    </div>
    <h4 class="text-left">A couple things to look for...</h4>
    <h4 class="text-left"><em><strong>Notebook, The Sandbox and GitHub Repositories</strong></em></h4>
    <h4>Notebook</h4>
    <p>
        Notebook contains my unauthoritative notes, discussions and casual observations. Covering whatever topics I may be facing.
        Usually dealing with the function and design of the site itself, or A Scalable Document Archive &amp; Libary Server.
        Some rundowns may reference a corresponding GitHub repository, indicated by the GitHub kitty-cat.
        The entire code base of DefaultWebsite.net Core is statically mirrored at GitHub from Visual Studio Team Foundation Services.
    </p>
    <p title="The Sandbox">
        <h4>The Sandbox</h4>
        The Sandbox is where the Live-Action happens!&nbsp; Sandbox Toys usually stem from something topical I am working on.
        Checkout the Sandbox for current and upcoming tools. This will always be changing...
    </p>
    <h4>GitHub Repository</h4>
    <div class="h4 dws-text text-left ml-3 mt-3"><span class="title">Default Web Site</span><span class="net">.net </span><span class="core">Core</span> 
    is mirrored on GitHub!! Awesome!
