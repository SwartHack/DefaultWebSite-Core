    This demo has taken on a life of its own, and continues to grow. It is defining the file operation&rsquo;s backbone for the
    .NET Core version of A Document Archive Server. The demo derives mostly from these two tutorials:
    <a href="https://github.com/muhammad-magdy/UploadingFileUsingAjaxAndHTML5">muhammad-magdy/UploadingFileUsingAjaxAndHTML5</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreFileUploadFileTable">damienbod/AspNetCoreFileUploadFileTable</a>

</p>
<p>
    The biggest excitement here, at first, is using SQl Server&rsquo;s FileTable for server-side file storage.
    There are a few caveats though and not convinced it is the best approach as it is Not Transactional. Some T-SQL
    would be in order to keep things orderly. The AdventureWorks demo database includes lots of T-SQL we get into over there.
    For now, may have to implement a few &ldquo;workarounds&rdquo; for demo&rsquo;s sake&hellip;

    Although versed in file operations, A Document Archive Server had concentrated mostly on &ldquo;download/display&rdquo;.
    This demo takes the next step by providing a &ldquo;File Upload&rdquo; dialog. The goal being to upload and display as many
    different file types as possible. The challenge being sorting it all out, while avoiding malicious file types&hellip;
</p>
<p>Currently we are supporting the following mime types for upload and display:</p>
<p>image/*, application/pdf, video/*</p>
<p>Working on these mime types:</p>
<p>OpenXml types </p>
